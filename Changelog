v0.6.3 - 
Fixed lightLevel logging to work consistently

v0.6.2 - July 12, 2011
Fixed bug introduced as a result of lightLevel change (when not using
logLightLevel)

v0.6.1 - July 12, 2011
Added ability to log worlds into separate files
Added ability to suppress notifications from certain worlds
Added lightLevel logging, although it appears buggy at the moment, Bukkit
reports 0 light level on blocks with torches right next to them. Will take
some more research, but you can enable it as just extra log information for
now.
Changed logger to be near real-time rather than on a 10 second delay.
Added WatchDog to be sure logger is restarted if it dies.

v0.6 - July 9, 2011
added several tuneable parameters to ore flagging to help admins tune out
false positives
added in-game notification system via "logores.notify" permission and
"logores.notify.ignore" for ignoring notifications from certain players
(such as mods/admins)

v0.5.1 - July 9, 2011
added permissions/op check "logores.admin" for /lo command
First public release

v0.5 - July 9, 2011
Moved various config options into config file
Added automatic flagging based on admin-defined ratio (makes it easy to search
through logs for possible cheat violations)

v0.4 - July 8, 2011
Added non-ore block counting as a way of adjusting the ratio to rule out
false positives as well as a lightweight way of detecting possible caves

v0.3 - July 7, 2011
Changed log formatting, added distance/time/ratio
Cleaned up debug messages
Changed log writer to run on scheduled intervals (less disk writes)
