v1.0.2 - Nov 14, 2012
* fixed to be compatible with bleeding Bukkit v1.4.4 builds (thanks Guyag for the fast PR)
* cleaned up some minor file resource leaks (identified by JDK 1.7 compiler - thanks Java)

v1.0.1 - Jul 28, 2012
* merged pull request from @Sancta for DB logging fixes (untested by me & presumed to be working, let me know if you find otherwise)
* converted to maven for build system to make it easier for other devs to build & contribute
* updated to latest common Permission code, should fix reported issue with notifications/ops

v1.0 - Mar 5, 2012
* Bukkit R5 event system update
* WEPIF permission system fixes for WorldEdit 5.1/5.2+
* "build.number" error fix

v0.9 - December 22, 2011
* code fixes for reported Synchronized access errors when used with NoLagg plugin
* updated Config files to 1.0-style FileConfiguration classes
* built against RB #1597
* refactored Permissions checks to use my general Permissions-agnostic code
* this release includes the logType "mysql", originally written by @Sancta

v0.8 - September 10, 2011
- Small performance improvement in onBlockBreak(); for the majority of mining
we now only have to do a single if() integer comparison and we're done.
- Major improvement to cave detection. Plugin now efficiently stores the last
50 blocks a player has mined in a circular buffer. When doing a cave check
(which happens in a separate thread, not on main Bukkit thread), it now checks
nearby air blocks against the player's recently mined blocks to determine if
they are in a cave or a player-mined tunnel. This results in significantly
more accurate cave detection and therefore less false positives.

v0.7 - August 4, 2011
-Refactored code to support multiple loggers, defined using "logTypes" config
param. Will be easy now to add DB logging when I get around to it.
-Created new logger type "excel", logs to .data file in | separated format
-Changed logging routine back to every 5 seconds on suspicion that perhaps
the blocking logger might have been causing some of the performance issues a
few people reported on older versions of java
-Added paranoidDiamonds flag, on by default. It operates the same as normal
orelogging/ratios except it's only looking at the difference between diamonds.
This means if someone nabs a diamond, grabs an iron ore in between and then
nabs another diamond, only the ratio between the two diamonds is looked at.
Also the cave algorithm and variance are ignored for diamonds. The net effect
is that with this flag on, the logs are more likely to notice diamond cheaters
that might have been able to fly under the radar before.
-Fixed NPE bug on shutdown.
-Added "flagging.flagWhenZeroLight" (default: off) which will flag events
when they are being mined in zero light. Zero light does not necessarilly mean
a person is ore hacking, but it's does most likely mean they are light hacking
(ie. they don't need torches to see in the dark).
-Added counter and reasons to flags, so you will see how many consecutive
flagged events a person has as well as the reasons they were flagged (ratio,
lightLevel, paranoidDiamonds).

v0.6.3 - July 17, 2011
Fixed lightLevel logging to work consistently

v0.6.2 - July 12, 2011
Fixed bug introduced as a result of lightLevel change (when not using
logLightLevel)

v0.6.1 - July 12, 2011
Added ability to log worlds into separate files
Added ability to suppress notifications from certain worlds
Added lightLevel logging, although it appears buggy at the moment, Bukkit
reports 0 light level on blocks with torches right next to them. Will take
some more research, but you can enable it as just extra log information for
now.
Changed logger to be near real-time rather than on a 10 second delay.
Added WatchDog to be sure logger is restarted if it dies.

v0.6 - July 9, 2011
added several tuneable parameters to ore flagging to help admins tune out
false positives
added in-game notification system via "logores.notify" permission and
"logores.notify.ignore" for ignoring notifications from certain players
(such as mods/admins)

v0.5.1 - July 9, 2011
added permissions/op check "logores.admin" for /lo command
First public release

v0.5 - July 9, 2011
Moved various config options into config file
Added automatic flagging based on admin-defined ratio (makes it easy to search
through logs for possible cheat violations)

v0.4 - July 8, 2011
Added non-ore block counting as a way of adjusting the ratio to rule out
false positives as well as a lightweight way of detecting possible caves

v0.3 - July 7, 2011
Changed log formatting, added distance/time/ratio
Cleaned up debug messages
Changed log writer to run on scheduled intervals (less disk writes)

v0.2 - July 6, 2011
Several bug fixes
Ant build system

v0.1 - July 5, 2011
Initial code complete dev version for testing
